I am 19-year-old Filipino American student at Seattle Central earning a certificate in Software Development and Testing in the Yearup program. Through which I am learning to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I plan on bringing a unique perspective to the tech industry very soon. 

I have a background in early childhood development, coaching, and the food industry. Through these, I have been able to work with a variety of ages, which taught me both patience and the importance of teamwork. I have also developed organization and time management skills working in many fast-paced environments. 

I love to creator things and make art on my freetime. I have designed and marketed a website alongside my colleague and plan on continuing my journey of creating.
